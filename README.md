# Chapter 1: Introduction
In an era defined by digital transformation and interconnectedness, the paramount
importance of network security is undeniable. Malicious actors are developing
increasingly sophisticated malicious software and tools in order to exploit existing
system vulnerabilities. We require a robust cybersecurity system to defend against
cyberattacks and intrusions.
# 1.1 Overview
The subsequent segments of this report delve into the specifics of each aspect. It
provides a comprehensive literature review that lays the groundwork for
comprehending the significance of intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and
log management.
# 1.2 Background and Context
As organizations heavily depend on digital infrastructure, the risk of cyber threats
looms larger than ever. In the age of network security, Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDS) play a vital role by effectively detecting and promptly addressing incidents of
unauthorized access, anomalies, and malicious actions. Additionally, Vulnerability
Assessment Tools like Nessus help in the identification of vulnerabilities and
weaknesses of a system or network.
# 1.3 Research Objectives
Nessus used to perform vulnerability scanning of systems and networks, identifying
weaknesses and flaws that could be exploited by attackers.The main purpose of IDS
to identify intrusions in a network or system. It detects any unauthorized or malicious
activity .Used Splunk’s powerful analytics engine to detect complex security incidents,
correlate disparate events, and provide actionable insights for rapid incident
response.
# 1.4 Significance of the Study
Integrating Snort, Nessus, and Splunk provides a multidimensional approach to
network security. In addition, the study explores the ethical dimensions of network
security automation, which reflects the broader societal and technological
innovations.
# 1.5 Scope and Limitations
The research is conducted in a controlled environment using Kali Linux and Ubuntu
to simulate real-world network interactions and potential attacks. While the integration
of Snort, Nessus, and Splunk has the potential for diverse network configurations, this
project focuses predominantly on demonstrating the approach’s viability and
efficiency in this environment.
